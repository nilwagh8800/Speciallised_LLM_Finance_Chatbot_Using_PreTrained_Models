# Speciallised_LLM_Finance_Chatbot_Using_PreTrained_Models

Project Background

With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in transforming various industries by automating and enhancing communication. These models, especially those leveraging architectures like GPT-3 and beyond, are capable of understanding and generating human-like text, making them ideal for creating intelligent conversational agents.

This capstone project focuses on harnessing the power of pre-trained LLMs from platforms like Hugging Face to develop industry-specific bots. Students are given the freedom to choose from a diverse array of industries, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities for applying LLM technology. The selected industry will guide the data collection process, ensuring that the bot is trained on relevant and specific information to enhance its contextual understanding and response accuracy.

By engaging in this project, students will not only learn to fine-tune pre-trained models but also gain hands-on experience in handling real-world data. The project is designed to be manageable even for those with limited computational resources, allowing training on Google Colab with T4 GPUs for up to 25 epochs. The primary objective is to build a bot that can think and engage with users effectively, providing coherent and contextually appropriate answers.

This project serves as a foundation for the Industry Immersion module, where students will extend their work into a comprehensive research paper, delving deeper into the chosen industry's specific applications and implications of LLM technology. This holistic approach ensures that students are well-prepared to tackle real-world challenges using cutting-edge AI technologies.

Project Objectives:

Industry Selection: Select one industry, this industry will be the focus of their project, including data collection and model training.

Data Collection: Gather relevant data specific to the chosen industry. This data will be used to fine-tune the pre-trained model to ensure the LLM Bot is knowledgeable and contextually aware of industry-specific information.

Model Selection and Training: Utilize any pre-trained model from Hugging Face or similar platforms. Fine-tune the model on the collected data using resources like Google Colab with T4 GPUs, limiting the training to a maximum of 25 epochs to ensure feasibility.

Bot Development: Develop the LLM Bot that can interact with users, providing answers and engaging in meaningful conversations specific to the chosen industry. The bot should demonstrate the ability to understand and process industry-related queries effectively.

Demonstration: Create an explanatory video showcasing the working of the LLM Bot. The video should highlight the bot's ability to handle industry-specific questions, demonstrating its practical application.
